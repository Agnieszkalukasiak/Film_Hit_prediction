    f"* This pipeline uses a Random Forest model optimized through GridSearchCV to predict movie revenues. \n"
    f"* The model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.15, showing the challenge of predicting exact movie revenues. \n"
    f"* Budget is the most influential feature, accounting for 46.7% of prediction weight. \n"
    f"* Genre factors like Comedy (4.6%), Drama (4.4%), and Thriller (4.2%) also play significant roles. \n"
    f"* The model performs with an RMSE of $1.06 and MAE of $0.89 on logged, scaled revenue values."
