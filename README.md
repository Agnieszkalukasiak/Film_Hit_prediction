## Film Hit Prediction

## Note to the assessment team
"This project is my final submission for the Full Stack Software Development diploma, where I have built a data-driven application using Streamlit. Learning everything from scratch and making this project in just six weeks — without tutor support and with limited mentorship or as in my case damaging mentorship (* I will add a specific note regarding that to the submission, to better explain what happened and how it effected this project.")—made the journey incredibly challenging. However, it has been equally rewarding to create an app that holds real value for me and my colleagues in the film industry. Exploring the data has been fascinating, revealing unexpected correlations and insights that I hadn't considered before. Although time constraints and technical limitations meant I couldn't include more complex data and processing, I am excited to continue developing this app in the future with enhanced features and deeper analysis."

## Dataset Content
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. We then created a user story based on the needs of an film investment company, 08Industries, where predictive analytics could be applied. 

The dataset has data on 5000 films in tow sets, one with 4 rows represeting movies id, title, cast, crew. The other dataset has 20 rows and represent budget, genres, homepage, id, keywords, original_language, original_title, overview, popularity, production_companies, production_countries, release_date, revenue, runtime, spoken_languages, status, tagline, title, vote_average, vote_count 
. In combination they are all the film data. Theweakness of the dataset is that it last was updated 8 years ago so the data is not up to date.  


## Business Requirements

08 Indusrties, an film investment company wants to invest in a film. As investment in films happens prior in greenlight, 08 Industries wanted to apply predictive analytics to try and assess the safety of their investmnet.

1 - 08 Industires are interested in discovering how the variables of the project known before greenlight correlate to the film revenue, to assess the safety of investing in films.

2 - 08 Industries is interested in predicting the revenue and profit from the variables of the film, avaialble prior to the greenlight. 


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
